\section{R and Voyant stopwordlist}
\subsection{Journal for homework 2019-10-24}


\textbf{10:49} I copy-pasted the Voyant stopwordlist into R 

\textbf{10:51} I tried different combinations to see how to categorize the words

\textbf{11:38} I typed ([\textbackslashæ]) in the top box, and in the substitution box i typed ae, to replace all æ with ae. I then copy-pasted the new substituted text up to the main text, to do it all again - only this time with the letter ø to oe. I did the same again with å to aa. 

\textbf{11:41} I now have a text that is clean from æøå, and will try to isolate each word from the " and ,

\textbf{11:45} If I type (\textbackslashw[a-z]+) i isolate each word - with a few exceptions of words with special characters that I will have to eliminate. 

\textbf{11:49} I typed in ([",]) and in the substitution line typed in the dollarsign and the number 1 only to delete it again. I then typed in \textbackslash n in the substitution line, but found that it made too many new lines between each word. 

\textbf{11:54} To see which other special characters there are, I isolate each word again, and find that the special characters that I need to eliminate are ü, é, ' and . 

\textbf{12:00} I give up for now.

\textbf{2019-10-29}I spoke to Mette Bonnema, and she explained to me how she had done it. I simply had to isolate the " and , by typing them once, and then copying the substitution line. 
I then went on to help two of my fellow students with the same problem, and found it very usefull to have to explain it to someone else.

\section{RStudio}
\subsection{Notes from lectures about RStudio}


Wrote dit.create("data"), which created a new folder on my computer
Wrote dir.create("./scripts"), which also created a new folder


Getwd ()
	- Means get working directory - the same as pwd in gitbash

"hashtag"comment
	- R ignores everything you write after the hashtag

List.files 
- you get a list of the content of the folder you are in


When i need help i can write ?getwd, and it will appear with a help list that is way too complicated to actually help me with anything.

Wrote getwd () and it created an absolute path to my position

#creating objects in R
12/4
(area_hectares <- 1.0)

	- Og så dukkede det op som en value ovre i vinduet til højre
Jeg kan ændre på denne value ved fx at skrive area_hectares <- 2.5 eller et andet tal til sidst.
